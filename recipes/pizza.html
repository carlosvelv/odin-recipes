    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>     This recipe guides you through creating a classic homemade pizza from scratch. It features a simple yeast dough that rises to create a perfectly chewy and airy crust. The base is topped with a bright, savory tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and herbs, which is then covered with melted mozzarella and your choice of toppings. The pizza is baked at a high temperature until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese is bubbly and delicious.

        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional, to help activate yeast)</li>
        <li>Canned Whole or Crushed Tomatoes (San Marzano recommended)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>Activate the yeast in warm water, optionally with a pinch of sugar.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour.</li>
    <li>Mix until a shaggy dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Gently punch down the risen dough and divide it as needed.</li>

    <li>While the dough rises, prepare your pizza sauce (e.g., blend canned tomatoes with garlic, oregano, and salt).</li>
    <li>Shred your low-moisture mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Slice your pepperoni.</li>

    <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting (e.g., 500°F or 260°C) with a pizza stone or baking sheet inside.</li>
    <li>On a floured surface, stretch or roll your dough into the desired shape.</li>
    <li>Transfer the shaped dough to a pizza peel or parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin, even layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
    <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese.</li>
    <li>Carefully slide the pizza (on the parchment or from the peel) onto the hot stone or baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
